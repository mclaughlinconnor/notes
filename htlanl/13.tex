\mintinline{python}{static} variables are the same for all instances of a class and they are defined outside of all the methods, which means that anything static can be called without instantiating the class first (which also mean they cannot access \mintinline{python}{self} or \mintinline{python}{super} because they don't exist).

\mintinline{python}{final} is the keyword for constants in Java.
Being a constant means that the variable cannot be overwritten.
\mintinline{python}{final} classes cannot be inherited from.
