\section{Session One}\label{sec:session_one}

This course is for uncovering how computers work individually and together as networks.
``Stay high level when you can, but go low level when you must''

All teaching will be done solo via recordings with live sessions saved for tutorials, group discussions and labs.
The live lessons will be \(1\) hour of teaching with \(1\) hour of time to review for the next lesson.

    \item \(\mathbf{10\%}\) \textbf{total}: All classroom tests (roughly \(1\) test per unit)
    \item \(\mathbf{20\%}\) \textbf{total}: Two assessed exercises (\(1\) for architecture, \(1\) for networks)
    \item \(\mathbf{10\%}\) \textbf{total}: Short quizzes from most live lessons
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Group Work and Peer Learning}\label{sub:group_work_and_peer_learning}

Sometimes group work is good, sometimes it isn't; you should find your own balance.
Consider ``think, pair, share''.
