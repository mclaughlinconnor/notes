\section{Data Structures}\label{sec:data_structures}

We almost always want to work with collections of data, so we almost always must use a \emph{data structure}.

For data to work in a data structure, there must be some relationship between all of the pieces of data.
The standard data structures are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Arrays
    \item 2D arrays
    \item Records/dictionaries
    \item Stacks
    \item Queues
\end{itemize}
