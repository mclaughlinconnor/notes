\subsection{Allocation and Reallocation}\label{sub:allocation_and_reallocation}

\begin{code}{c}
    int main() {
        int * number = malloc(sizeof(int)); // Pointer to the heap
        // Allocates array of length 5, hard to read, mistakes are easy
        int * number = malloc(sizeof(int) * 5); 
        // Allocates contiguous length of 5 integers, nice to read
        int * number = calloc(sizeof(int), 5); 
        int * number = malloc(sizeof(int));

        // To reuse a variable, we can free it, but we might not get the same
        // space, and it looks a bit nasty
        free(number);
        char * string[2] = calloc(sizeof(char), 2);

        // Or we can reallocate that memory instead, which is faster because 
        // it doesn't always need to free and allocate the whole memory space,
        // is very fast and is the recommender way of doing this.
        char * string[2] = realloc(number, sizeof(char) * 2);
    }
\end{code}

\subsection{Dangling Pointers}\label{sub:dangling_pointers}

\begin{code}{c}
    int main() {
        int * number = malloc(sizeof(int));
        free(number);

        // We still have the pointer address, but we don't own that memory
        // This is undefined behaviour, maybe causes a SegmentationFault.
        *number = *number + 6
        // There is no way around this, C is just doing what it's told.
    }
\end{code}

\subsection{Use After Free and Memory Leaks}\label{sub:use_after_free}

\begin{code}{c}
    #include <string.h>

    typedef struct address {
        int housenumber;
        char postcode[9];
    } address_t;

    address_t * createAddress(int housenumber, char * postcode) {
        // Allocate new space
        address_t * newAddress = malloc(sizeof(address_t));
        newAddress->housenumber = housenumber;
        // Not covered yet, we'll look at strings tomorrow
        strcpy(newaddress->postcode, postcode);
        newaddress->postcode = postcode;

        return newAddress
    }

    int main() {
        address_t * connorHouse = createAddress(123, "G11AA");
        connorHouse = createAddress(124, "G11AA"); // Value of connorHouse changes

        // We can no longer access the original connorHouse because we have lost
        // the address of it. We cannot call free() because we don't know what to free. 
        // When the program finishes, the operating system will free that memory. This
        // is a memory leak.

        // Free connorHouse
        free(connorHouse);

        // We can no longer access that memory, so the operating system kills the program
        // (undefined behaviour)
        printf("Connor: %d %s", connorHouse->housenumber, connorHouse->postcode);

        // This is a "double free" program, the operating system kills the program
        // (undefined behaviour)
        free(connorHouse);
    }
\end{code}
